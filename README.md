# HostBridge for VSCode

This extension adds options to Make, Execute, and Put Hostbridge scripts on the Explorer context menu as well as the Editor context menu.  It also adds a Hostbridge Explorer that acts as a host repository browser.  The repository browser provides context menu options to Get and Delete content items.

Please note this extension is still considered beta.
